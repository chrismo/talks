Before I get going, given the current state of things with the internet these
days, concerns about privacy and folks struggling to have control over their
own information, I just need to say this: everything I’m about to say is off
the record.

Greetings, my name is Chris Morris - I’m the director of engineering for
Mystery Science - NOT Theater 3000 - nerds

WE make awesome science videos and activities for elementary age kids. 

If you wanna come help save the next generation’s brains, come join us.

5 years ago, on this very spot, in Portland, I gave a lightning talk on
Impostor Syndrome. I've returned today, 5 years in the future, to talk about
something completely different.

This is my profile on GitHub. I’m not showing this to you to brag about the
huge number of repos I’ve forked and never done anything with, nor is it to
share my joy over it being the only online service where I’ve been able to
obtain my preferred login name without having to resort to creativity.

We in the Ruby community have this acronym. Who knows this one? 

What are you doing? You don't have a microphone, no one can hear you.

It means Matz Is Nice So We Are Nice.

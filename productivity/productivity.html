## Habits of a 2.76x Developer

???

-- Talk prepped for Jan 2018 meetup of http://devproductivity.io

My name is Chris Morris, I've been developing software for over 20 years, I'm 
currently the Director of Engineering at Mystery Science, before that I spent
6 years at LivingSocial/Groupon and am technically still a core
team member of Bundler, but I haven't contributed there in a while.

Before we get into my talk today, some shout-outs:

---

# Healthy Programmer

.center[<img src="http://imagery.pragprog.com/products/323/jkthp.jpg" style="width: 33%;" /> 
        <img src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/3a67e4ea496cbad39b23bf48e046c810/tumblr_nasiplAH851qhu3vxo1_500.gif" style="width: 50%" />]

???

This book was published in 2013, so, y'know, like light years ago, but The
Healthy Programmer has some wonderfully practical advice for those of us who
make a living the way we do.

In short: "Read this book so you don't die in your chair." Hat tip to my friend
Sara Flemming for the jeh-gif.

I never know how to say it, so I just say it both ways.

# Open Sourcing Mental Illness

.center.four-big[osmihelp.org<br/><br/>]
.center[<img src="https://osmihelp.org/assets/img/osmi-logo-big.png" style="width: 33%" />]

???

The OSMI support forums evolved out of a site called Devpressed started by Greg
Baugues, they can be a great place to get some support for yourself or if know
someone who struggles with mental issues.

# The Pragmatic Programmer  

.center[<img src="https://imagery.pragprog.com/products/59/tpp.jpg?1339433898" style="width: 45%" />]

???

Then finally, since this talk will largely be on a process and tactical level,
I have to give a shout out to the classic Pragmatic Programmer book since a lot
of the stuff in my talk is either ripped off from or inspired by this book.

---

layout: false
class: center, middle

.center[<img src="10x.programmer.png"/>]

???

The idea of a 10x developer can at least be traced back to a 1996 book by Steve
McConnell called Rapid Development and possibly the 1st edition in 1993 of his
book Code Complete, which in turn cite earlier studies, the quality of which
are easily called into question.

.center[<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/leprechauns/hero?1498560320" style="width: 40%"/>]

???

For a counterpoint view on 10x and other topics, one resource you can check out
is The Leprechauns of Software Engineering, which arose specifically from a
critique on Steve McConnell's writings on the 10x developer.

The 10x developer, or 5x, or 2x, or 1.1x may be a myth, but if they do exist,
in my opinion they subsist on small habits that buy themselves productivity
over the long haul, vs. folks who can just type 10 times as fast as you.

# Trade-Offs

![Pass the salt](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_general_problem.png)

???

Most experienced developers understand that quality engineering involves
trade-offs. Security vs. Convenience, code that reads well vs. performs well,
and short-term vs. long-term productivity.

One of my favorite XKCD comics captures this tension we have to struggle with
every day.

---

# Small Gains Over Time

.center[<img src="graph.png" style="width: 70%" />]

???
Every day we have to make these little decisions between manual and
automated salt, and we'll mess up many of them, but if we're
consistently weighing out both the short and long term, we can experience
the multiplicative benefits of solid tooling.

A better balance of compromise can lead to hellacious productivity.

# Long > Short

.center[![Ketchup bottle](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03245/ketchupembed_3245375b.jpg)]

Considering the long term impact of our decisions is usually the wiser approach.

# If You Gotta Ship Fast

Sometimes we gotta get stuff out the door, and that can get messy

# Negotiate Cleanup 

        
.center[<img src="http://cdn3.momsxyz.com/2015/09/kids-baking-1-1024x629.gif" style="width: 80%" />]        

???

But when that happens, be sure to negotiate for time to clean up your mess. So
you can have your squirrel and ketchup cake and eat it too.

# Testing

.center[<img src="avengers.storyboard.png" style="width: 60%"/>]

???

I'm going to talk a lot about testing. Software development may be an 
unusual field in how segregated the notion of testing is from coding, 
when in my POV, testing and coding are two sides of the same coin 
called "Design". 

Composers naturally iterate over their pieces. Artists will do studies, a 
drawing, sketch or painting in preparation for a finished piece. Writers 
have editors, directors storyboard their movies. 
   
It's all part of an essential feedback loop.

# Testing?

.big-para[@dbrady: It's 2018. Do you really think testing is good? All this
talk of fast, clean, readable, etc I'm starting to feel like we think testing
sucks. Slow, ugly, unreadable all suck. Fast, clean, readable isn't good, just
less sucky. Is testing good, or just an accepted evil?]
???
David Brady tweeted this recently - Do you really think testing is good? ...

???
I replied that Tests help me think about and even shape the design of my
production code. It has a built-in rubber duck effect.

https://twitter.com/the_chrismo/status/951587076138442752

dbrady @the_chrismo @alexford THIS is literally the first reply all day that
proposes an intrinsic benefit of testing rather than an investment/cost to be
minimized and/or whose eventual payoff is hoped to be maximized Jan 11, 2018,

# Testing!

.center.one-big[Test yo self before yo self.fail!]

???

David's tweet isn't surprising to me, and not just because I see it in
others who may not understand how great it is that we can take it for
granted these days, but because I still see this in myself. Sometimes, 
in the NAME of productivity, it can be tempting to skimp on testing. 

But - the sooner we can understand what we're building, the sooner
we can catch misunderstandings, the cheaper it is and therefore the more 
productive 
we are. We can't do that without many of the feedback tools we use, 
testing being a powerful one.

# Two Clients for All Code

One of the most prevalent killers in software is tight coupling.

# Test Suite as Deploy Checklist

.center[<img src="https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/67492661/i-wrote-them-down-in-my-diary-so-that-i-wouldnt-have-to-remember.jpg" style="width: 100%" />]

???
In addition to feedback during development of new code, re-running our tests
can protect previously developed code.

Checklists are a powerful tool used in aviation and medicine to avoid mental
errors and making sure things are working before flying away from the ground or 
cutting open a patient. 

Our test suites are a huge, automated pre-deploy checklist.

# Speed: Tap the Brakes

.center[<img src="http://mealsandmiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/fast-furious-poster-big-new-fast-furious-7-poster-brings-the-awesome-previous-6-posters-bring-the-sad-682x1024.jpeg" style="width: 33%" />]

???

I did just say "huge" - and this transitions us to one common problem with
test suites: they just run so dang slow. 

It's great that we want quick feedback ... don't let that lead you into 
obsessed with the speediness of your test suite. 

---

# Speed: Worse Alternatives

.center[<img src="https://www.tinypulse.com/hs-fs/hubfs/b40a2331160baece046d108ab53aabb0.jpg" style="width: 70%" />]

???

First, remember that one alternative to your slow automated test suite is a 
separate
QA dept that's under-resourced on time and people and you have to wait 3+ weeks
to get shrug-percent coverage.


---

# Speed: Over Mocking

.center[<img src="bad.mocking.example.png" style="width: 40%"/>]

???

In this contrived example, you can see how tests can pass when they 
shouldn't, and pursuing too many mocks in the name of speed can 
deteriorate the quality of your tests.

# Speed: Run What You Need

## Bundler:

.one-big.remark-code[ruby bin/rspec spec/bundler/definition_spec.rb spec/resolver/basic_spec.rb]

???

The Bundler test suite is not only large and slow, but some of the tests are
specific to certain platforms and getting the whole thing to run locally can be
difficult.

My pattern was to use RubyMine to run the specific test my cursor was on, then
run the current file, then use a shell script like the above to get a wider
run of feedback from several files, then commit to a branch and let CI tell me
how things are going broadly.

In cases like this, I usually only run the tests I need to locally, and lean on
CI to cover the whole thing.

By building out shell scripts like this you can focus on the tests most likely to
give you the most valuable feedback early. By saving and curating these scripts 
you can also discover some interesting boundaries of the code base
that could come in handy when you want to try and break it up into gems or
services. More on that in a moment.

# If Speed Is A Concern

skimping on unit tests in favor of integration tests could work.

# Libraries and Services

.center[![Component Diagram](https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Microservices-Cubes-300x300-PMS355.png)] 

???

Mind your boundaries. Services classes gems are just different mechanisms to
enforce boundaries, count the cost. Sometimes we choose a harder boundary to
force decoupling, when if we just tested in isolation more, we could achieve
the same thing Sometimes moving code out into its own gem or service will help
not only with the boundary, but with minimizing the test suite that needs to be
run inside a monolith. Of course, now you’ve opened the door for integration
test failures.

---

# Test in Production
???
There's a difference between putting untested things into production 
recognizing  
There's nothing like production. Few shops can afford to pull off a true 
staging environment (or blue/green deployments).
--
.center.four-big[Exploratory]


???

Sometimes the only way to test things in production is to test it in
production. Do this judiciously, but recognize when you need it and use feature
flags to protect the general user population. Trying to build up a staging
environment that’s just like production so I don’t need to test in production
can be a big distraction. Make sure you can revert quickly. Rescue nil can be
your friend when judiciously used in cases like this - but only temporarily.

Ok, enough about testing.

# Refactoring / OOP

When in Branson … https://i.pinimg.com/474x/1c/d3/51/1cd3515613f1213dd47375c71bd2aa9d--branson-missouri-redneck.jpg
???

If you work in an OOP language, know your OOP. SOLID principles. Sandi Metz. Go
with the grain. This isn’t so much about short term productivity, but buying
you long term flexibility. Know your basic refactorings - if nothing else, know
that most refactorings have an opposite. This is the more artsy side of
engineering.


---

# Delete Old Code

???

It’s a time waster. It clogs your IDE, it gets included in grep results and can
waste time doing analysis on stuff that’s not even used anymore. Production
code coverage tools are a thing. https://github.com/danmayer/coverband

---

# Ask for Help

???

Rubber duck in Slack (have a rubber duck room). Rubber duck in your
card/ticket. Take a walk and talk out loud like a crazy person. Come up for
air, take breaks.

---

# Pair
???
Pairing can yield interesting insights into how others do things. 

---

# Good commit messages
.center.one-big[Explain yo self before you forget yo self.]
???

Not just commit messages, code comments, class names, methods, readme. Pay
attention to the distance between the code and where the documentation resides.
If you need separate docs, look to automate what you can so the docs stay 
close to the source.

---

# Keep Your Throwaway Code

.center[<img src="1998_samandfriends.jpg" style="width: 50%" />] 

???

Unlike your desktop and closet, we essentially have unlimited

Keep and commit all of the code you use when troubleshooting something or doing
routine tasks.

This is one habit I don’t see often enough. At LivingSocial, our ops folks were
really good about ensuring console history was kept after someone left. That’s
great. Except that if I’m taking the time to write it in the first place, then
I should stash it somewhere, commit it. You won’t come back to all of it, you
may not even come back to most of it, but the stuff you will come back to can
be refined and iterated on, and eventually some of it will make it into the
production codebase.

---
# DRY: Manual Labor

.center.one-big-tall[Automate yo self before you continue to do the same ol' damn thing over and over again until you 
give carpel tunnel to yo self.]
???

As much as we love automation, it’s amazing how often we’ll still get into
cesspools of manual labor. One reason why it can be invaluable to rotate team
members into a part of a codebase or work routine, so they can notice the
stale, wasteful habits we all accrue and help us automate away our manual
crutches.

---


# Hack in Production
???

Put the code in an editor. Use a redefinition of the class to copy/paste code
into prod console to play with it there. But then Keep it!

---

# Build the Light 
Dark is the default.


---

Healthy teams are productive teams - this trumps the rest.

Does this mean that I've calculated the odds that going back in time 10 times, I know we'll have success
9 times?

Kathy Sierra in a 2006 post called "Don't make the Demo Look Done" talks about the impact
on feedback the quality of a mockup can have. A mockup that looks finished tends to illicit
more specific (and less useful) feedback.

# Vague Estimates are Vague

So when we apply this to estimates... which should be vague, based on guesses, hunches and experience

# Specific Numbers are Specific

If all I say is 'days' then the debate can stay in the realm of 'hours' vs 'days' without any specifics getting
in the way.

One of the best-known long-term Agile projects was Chrysler’s C3 payroll, the first Extreme Programming project.

I was once present for an exchange between Sue Unger, then CIO of Chrysler Corporation, and Kent Beck.
 Kent had just explained how we’d be working and Ms. Unger asked “How will I know whether you’re on track or not?”
 Kent said, “We ask you to visit us every month. We’ll show you [our task] cards, and show you how many are done and
 how many are left to do. If you’re not satisfied with the progress, cancel the project.”

Sue, said, “I can do that.”

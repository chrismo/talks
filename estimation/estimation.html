Devpressed support forum. I myself don't suffer from depression but my wife does.

If you or someone you know also suffers with it, or you'd just like to learn more about it, it's a good resource.

Kathy Sierra in a 2006 post called "Don't make the Demo Look Done" talks about the impact
on feedback the quality of a mockup can have. A mockup that looks finished tends to illicit
more specific (and less useful) feedback.

So when we apply this to estimates... which should be vague, based on guesses, hunches and experience

but numbers bring an undue level of specificity SPES-EH-FIC-EH-TEE, if we start talking numbers we
frequently start debating numbers. So what I say is

</table>        ]


???
If I limit myself to these four words,
If all I say is 'hours' or 'days' or maybe 'hours-to-days' then the debate can stay in the realm of the vague
and hopefully keep specifics from getting in the way.

# Ron Jeffries

.center.one-big["Estimates Are Evil"]

<br/><br/>

https://pragprog.com/magazines/2013-02/estimation-is-evil

???
In 2013 Ron Jeffries, one of the 3 founders of XP, one of the original agile methodologies, wrote this article
for the prag prog online magazine.

He says,

"One of the best-known long-term Agile projects was Chrysler’s C3 payroll, the first Extreme Programming project.

I was once present for an exchange between Sue Unger, then CIO of Chrysler Corporation, and Kent Beck.
 Kent had just explained how we’d be working and Ms. Unger asked “How will I know whether you’re on track or not?”
 Kent said, “We ask you to visit us every month. We’ll show you [our task] cards, and show you how many are done and
 how many are left to do. If you’re not satisfied with the progress, cancel the project.”

Sue, said, “I can do that.”

So we can see a de-emphasis of estimates from the get-go.

# XP 1st Edition

.center.one-big[Load Factor]

<br/><br/>

_see also http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/velocity.html_
???
But if you're saying what about Story Points, well it's an interesting progression. In fact, the 1st edition of
XP had this concept of Load Factor, which was a value you could factor into your task estimates to try and determine
the translation of ideal time to real time...
---

# XP 2nd Edition

.center.two-big[Story Points]
.center.two-big[Yesterday's Weather]

<br/><br/>

_see also http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/velocity.html_
???
Which was softened to be merely Story Points in the 2nd edition when many teams realized the effort of
figuring out Load Factor didn't pay for itself, and the notion of Yesterday's Weather started to take hold.

Why invest in an expensive computer model when all you really need to know is if there's some chance today
a tornado might rip my house off its foundation

# Story Time

Restricted deal bucks.

Things are going well.

Cassandra asks how it's going.

I say well,

She asks, how confident
---

# 90%?

???
But I decided to turn it around and I asked her
---

# If 10% Happens ... Then What?

???
If I said 90%, but the 10% happens, then what?

She said in that case they'd just want to shut down RaF over the holiday weekend.

She said that wouldn't be hard to do and we negotiated a contingency that if something
didn't fall into place, we could yank it out.

Even the night before, we were mostly ready, but I knew only one unplanned for thing
had to go wrong to derail the whole thing. But it was fine. Things weren't tense, we knew
this was how it could go, and even though it did work out, if we'd needed to pull the plug,
it would have been fine.

Most important to my talk here though, is I never had to give a number.
---

# Where'd The Numbers Go?

???
Because I believe there are other things more important than numbers.
---

# Contingency > Numbers

---

# Communication > Numbers

---

# Transparency > Numbers

---

# Managing Expectations > Numbers

???
Not only are these things _greater_ than numbers, put together
---

# Contingency
# Communication
# Transparency
# Managing Expectations

???
numbers don't even need to enter into the conversation.
